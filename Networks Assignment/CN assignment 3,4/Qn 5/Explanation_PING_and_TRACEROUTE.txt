1. There is no packet Loss in PING command so there is no error in network.
2. While executing traceroute command packet travels through router of default gateway 10.10.10.100
and then PC of another LAN 192.168.10.2.
3. So from this we confirm that packet transmitting is properly happening between 2 PC's in a network.
