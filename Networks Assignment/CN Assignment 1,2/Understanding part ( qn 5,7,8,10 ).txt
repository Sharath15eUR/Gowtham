QN 5 What happens when duplicate IPs are configured in a network?

When two devices are assigned the same IP address in a network, it results in an IP address conflict, causing network communication issues. 

Consequences of Duplicate IP Addresses:

Network Disruptions: If both devices have the same IP, packets may not reach the intended device.

Intermittent Connectivity: If both devices respond to ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests, network traffic becomes unstable.

Operating System Warnings:
Windows: "IP address conflict detected" message.
Linux/macOS: ARP messages or logs in dmesg/syslog.

DHCP Conflict Detection: If a DHCP server assigns an IP already in use, the client may reject it.

Switching Loops in Case of a Misconfigured Network: If both devices have the same IP and act as routers or gateways, loops can occur.
Security Concerns: Attackers can intentionally assign the same IP to hijack sessions (MITM attacks).


How to Prevent and Resolve IP Conflicts?

Use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): It automatically assigns unique IPs.

Enable IP Conflict Detection: Some OSs (e.g., Windows) detect conflicts and notify the user.

Check ARP Table: Run arp -a to check conflicting IPs.

Use Static IPs Carefully: Ensure no duplicate static IPs are manually configured.

Reboot Devices or Renew DHCP Lease: Use ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew (Windows) or dhclient -r && dhclient (Linux).



QN 7 . How to check if your default gateway is reachable? Understanding Default Gateway

Default gateway is a router that forwards traffic from your local network to other networks (e.g., the internet). 
If a packet's destination isn't in the local network, it's sent to the default gateway.

How to Check if the Default Gateway is Reachable?
1. Identify Your Default Gateway

  ipconfig or ifconfig

2. Ping the Default Gateway
 
  ping <gateway-IP>
  Successful response: The gateway is reachable.
  Request timed out / no response: The gateway is down or unreachable.

3. Trace the Route to the Default Gateway

  tracert <gateway-IP>   (Windows)
  traceroute <gateway-IP>  (Linux/macOS)

  This helps debug if packets are getting dropped.

4. Check ARP Table for Gateway MAC Address
If the default gateway is on the same subnet, check its MAC address:
arp -a
If the MAC address is missing or incorrect, there may be an issue with ARP resolution.




QN 8 . Understanding Network Interfaces using `iwconfig` and `ifconfig`

ifconfig` (Interface Configuration)
`ifconfig` is used to configure network interfaces (deprecated in favor of `ip` command in Linux).
Check Available Network Interfaces
ifconfig -a

This displays:
- **Interface Name** (`eth0`, `wlan0`, etc.)
- **IP Address** (`inet addr:192.168.1.100`)
- **Subnet Mask** (`Mask:255.255.255.0`)
- **MAC Address** (`HWaddr 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`)
- **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)**: Defines the largest packet size.
- **RX/TX Packets & Errors**: Number of received/transmitted packets and errors.


`iwconfig` (Wireless Network Configuration)
`iwconfig` is used to configure Wi-Fi interfaces.

Check Wireless Network Details

iwconfig wlan0

- **SSID (ESSID):** Name of the connected network.
- **Mode:** `Managed` (client mode) or `Monitor` (sniffing packets).
- **Frequency & Channel:** Used radio frequency.
- **Tx-Power:** Transmission power of the Wi-Fi card.
- **Signal Level:** Signal strength in dBm (e.g., `-50dBm` is strong, `-90dBm` is weak).
- **Bit Rate:** Current speed of the wireless connection.




QN 10. How Does a DHCP Server Assign IP Addresses?
What is DHCP?
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, and other network settings to devices.

DHCP Process (DORA)
Discovery: The client (new device) sends a DHCPDISCOVER message to locate a DHCP server.
Offer: The DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER containing an available IP.
Request: The client sends a DHCPREQUEST to confirm it wants the offered IP.
Acknowledgment: The server responds with a DHCPACK, assigning the IP.

How to Check DHCP Configuration?

ipconfig /all
Shows DHCP status, lease time, and assigned IP.

dhclient -v
Requests a new IP from the DHCP server.

Static vs Dynamic IP Assignment
Static IP: Manually assigned by an admin (e.g., servers, printers).
Dynamic IP: Assigned automatically by DHCP, expires after a lease period.
Reserved IP: DHCP assigns a specific IP to a MAC address.

Common DHCP Issues
IP Exhaustion: No available IPs left in the DHCP pool.
Lease Expiration: Device loses its IP and needs renewal.
DHCP Server Unreachable: Devices cannot get an IP.
